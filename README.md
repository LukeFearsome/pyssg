A static site generator built from scratch in Python as part of a Boot.dev project.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Code organization and modular architecture
- Recursive filesystem operations with `os` and `shutil`
- Markdown parsing with self-written layers of abstraction
- Test-driven development with unittest
- Breaking complex problems into smaller, testable units

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Recursively processes content directories
- ✅ Converts Markdown to HTML
- ✅ Outputs a fully static website
- ✅ Maintains directory hierarchy
- ✅ Simple shell script interface
- ✅ Unit tests

## 🧪 Testing with unittest

- Attempt at test driven development 
- Key lesson: tests saved significant debugging time
- Key lesson 2: even more tests would save even more debugging time
